            <p>Data Science is more than just analyzing numbers; it's about telling stories with data. But where do you start?</p>
            <h3>1. Master the Basics</h3>
            <p>Start with Python. It's the lingua franca of data science. Libraries like Pandas and NumPy are your bread and butter.</p>
            <h3>2. Statistics and Math</h3>
            <p>You don't need a PhD, but understanding probability, distributions, and hypothesis testing is crucial for making accurate inferences.</p>
            <h3>3. Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>Move beyond simple regressions. Explore decision trees, random forests, and eventually, neural networks.</p>

            <p>In an increasingly interconnected world, cybersecurity is no longer an option—it's a necessity. The threat landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace.</p>
            <h3>Zero Trust Architecture</h3>
            <p>The traditional perimeter-based security model is dead. 'Never trust, always verify' is the new mantra. Zero Trust assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network.</p>
            <h3>AI-Driven Threat Detection</h3>
            <p>Hackers are using AI to launch sophisticated attacks. To combat this, defenders are leveraging machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and respond to threats in real-time, faster than any human could.</p>
