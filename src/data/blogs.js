            <p>JavaScript is eating the world, and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) is its main course. Why does it remain the gold standard for full-stack development?</p>
            <h3>Unified Language</h3>
            <p>Using JavaScript across the entire stack streamlines development. Frontend developers can easily understand backend logic, and vice versa, fostering better team collaboration.</p>
            <h3>Performance and Scalability</h3>
            <p>Node.js's non-blocking I/O model ensures that applications can handle high traffic with ease, while React's virtual DOM offering lightning-fast user interfaces.</p>

            <p>Data Science is more than just analyzing numbers; it's about telling stories with data. But where do you start?</p>
            <h3>1. Master the Basics</h3>
            <p>Start with Python. It's the lingua franca of data science. Libraries like Pandas and NumPy are your bread and butter.</p>
            <h3>2. Statistics and Math</h3>
            <p>You don't need a PhD, but understanding probability, distributions, and hypothesis testing is crucial for making accurate inferences.</p>
            <h3>3. Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>Move beyond simple regressions. Explore decision trees, random forests, and eventually, neural networks.</p>
